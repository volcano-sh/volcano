# kube-arbitrator

kube-arbitrator provide policy based resource sharing for Kubernetes cluster, the following section describe the target scenario of this project:

As a cluster admin, I’d like to build an environment to run different workload together, e.g. long running service, bigdata. As those applications are managed by different department, I have to provide resource guarantee to each applications, demonstrated as following:
    
1. Long running service (app area) and bigdata (bigdata area) can share resources:
    * Define resource usage of each area, e.g. 40% resources to app area, 60% to bigdata area.
    * Borrow/lending protocol: if the resources is idle in one area, it can be lend out and be preempted back
1. Run multiple cluster in bigdata area:
    * Define resources usage of each cluster within bigdata area, e.g. Spark, Hadoop
    * Sharing resources between those big data clusters, e.g. borrow/lending protocol

The detail of requirements for the "bigdata" are

* Run a set of applications
* Provided each application guaranteed access to some quantity of resources
* Provided all applications best-effort access to all unused resources according to some target weight (one weight assigned to each application, i.e. if all applications wanted to use all free resources, then they would be allowed to do so in some relative proportion)
* If some application A is using less than its guarantee, and then if it decides to use its guarantee and there aren't enough free resources to do so, it should be able to evict tasks from some other application or applications (that is/are using more than their guarantee) in order to obtain its guarantee

Further, group "bigdata" apps and "service" apps into two buckets, providing each bucket (in aggregate) guaranteed access to some fraction of the cluster, and best-effort access to the entire cluster with the understanding that usage above the guarantee can be revoked at any time.
