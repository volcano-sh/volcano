[Volcano](https://volcano.sh/) is a Kubernetes-native batch scheduling system, extending and enhancing the capabilities of the standard kube-scheduler. It provides a comprehensive set of features specifically designed to manage and optimize various batch and elastic workloads, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) / deep learning (DL), bioinformatics / genomics, and other "Big Data" applications.

These workloads commonly leverage AI, Big Data, and HPC frameworks such as Spark, Flink, Ray, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Argo, MindSpore, PaddlePaddle, Kubeflow, MPI, Horovod, MXNet, KubeGene, and others, with which Volcano offers robust integration.

Volcano incorporates over fifteen years of collective experience in operating diverse high-performance workloads at scale across multiple systems and platforms. It combines proven best practices and innovative concepts from the open-source community to deliver a powerful and flexible scheduling solution.

As of 2025, Volcano has seen widespread adoption across numerous industries globally, including Internet/Cloud, Finance, Manufacturing, and Medical sectors. Many organizations and institutions are not only end-users but also active contributors to the project. Hundreds of contributors actively participate in code commits, pull request reviews, issue discussions, documentation updates, and design proposals. We encourage your participation in the ongoing development and growth of the Volcano project.


**NOTE**: the scheduler is built based on [kube-batch](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-batch);

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+ with CRD support


You can try Volcano by one of the following two ways.

Note: 
* For Kubernetes v1.17+ use CRDs under config/crd/bases (recommended)
* For Kubernetes versions < v1.16 use CRDs under config/crd/v1beta1 (deprecated)

### Install with YAML files

Install Volcano on an existing Kubernetes cluster. This way is both available for x86_64 and arm64 architecture.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcano-sh/volcano/master/installer/volcano-development.yaml
```

Enjoy! Volcano will create the following resources in `volcano-system` namespace.

### Install via helm

To install official release, please visit [helm-charts](https://github.com/volcano-sh/helm-charts) for details.

```bash
helm repo add volcano-sh https://volcano-sh.github.io/helm-charts
helm install volcano volcano-sh/volcano -n volcano-system --create-namespace
```

Install from source code for developers:

```bash
helm install volcano installer/helm/chart/volcano --namespace volcano-system --create-namespace

# list helm release
helm list -n volcano-system
```

### Install from code

If you don't have a kubernetes cluster, try one-click install from code base:

```bash
./hack/local-up-volcano.sh
```

This way is only available for x86_64 temporarily.

### Install volcano agent

Please follow the guide [Volcano Agent](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/colocation) to install volcano agent.

### Install monitoring system

If you want to get prometheus and grafana volcano dashboard after volcano installed, try following commands:

```bash
kubectl create -f installer/volcano-monitoring.yaml
```

### Install dashboard

Please follow the guide [Volcano Dashboard](https://github.com/volcano-sh/dashboard#volcano-dashboard) to install volcano dashboard.

Key:
* `✓` Volcano and the Kubernetes version are exactly compatible.
* `+` Volcano has features or API objects that may not be present in the Kubernetes version.
* `-` The Kubernetes version has features or API objects that Volcano can't use.
